*Internet Gateway*

An Internet Gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. It provides a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic and performs network address translation (NAT) for instances that have been assigned public IPv4 addresses.

Key Points:

Serves as an access point for the internet to your VPC.
Allows resources within your VPC (like EC2 instances) to access the internet.
Supports IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
Is a necessary component for any AWS VPC that requires direct access to the internet.
